There are two special values defined for this property : 0 - The protocol is stream-oriented; the concept of message size is not relevant .
1 - The maximum outbound (send) message size is dependent on the underlying network MTU (maximum sized transmission unit) and hence cannot be known until after a socket is bound .
Example : 00 : 80 : C7 : 8F : 6C : 96
Default : 1000 , Valid Range : 1 - 0xFFFFFFFF .
Default : 50 , Valid Range : 1 - 0xFFFFFFFE .
