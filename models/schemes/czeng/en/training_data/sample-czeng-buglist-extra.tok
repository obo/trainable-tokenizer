If , however , you are lucky enough to have your attention momentarily distracted at the crucial moment by , say , a gorgeous pair of legs ( tentacles , pseudopodia , according to phyllum and / or personal inclination ) or a bomb going off in your vicinity , or by suddenly spotting an extremely rare species of beetle crawling along a nearby twig , then in your astonishment you will miss the ground completely and remain bobbing just a few inches above it in what might seem to be a slightly foolish manner .

Of course a man like that would want to be in the field with a team he ' d helped organize : once a general , always a general .
It seemed so incredible : after a year of furtive contacts with the North , of working closely with Major Lee , with Captain Bock and his computer expert Private Koh , and even with the enemy himself , a second Korean War was about to become a reality .

All the - " and here he used a word I couldn ' t pronounce even if I could remember it - " got into the water - they can move quite quickly when they have to !

The accompanying photo was standard B - school graduate : against a gray background with light coming from behind one shoulder , it showed a young woman with shoulderlength hair in a pageboy style , a direct businesslike stare just shy of harsh , and a firm mouth .
Soon our company had changed wholly : from a gallop , with yelping dogs in the forefront , to a slow walk , with silent dogs hardly willing to lead the way , and instead falling back until they were underfoot the horses , thus causing some occasional difficulty .
For a moment it seemed to gain color and reality and then suddenly it became fixed ; like a hard , discarded chitinous shell it sagged , and burst .

' Why , Nancy ! ' said the Jew , in a soothing tone ; after a pause , during which he and Mr . Sikes had stared at one another in a disconcerted manner ; ' you , — you ' re more clever than ever to - night .
We behold , with throbbing bosoms , the heroine in the grasp of a proud and ruthless baron : her virtue and her life alike in danger , drawing forth her dagger to preserve the one at the cost of the other ; and just as our expectations are wrought up to the highest pitch , a whistle is heard , and we are straightway transported to the great hall of the castle ; where a grey - headed seneschal sings a funny chorus with a funnier body of vassals , who are free of all sorts of places , from church vaults to palaces , and roam about in company , carolling perpetually .
With a hoarse grunt of contempt , Mr . Sikes seized the glass , and threw the remainder of its contents into the ashes : as a preparatory ceremony to filling it again for himself : which he did at once .
He had relaxed nothing of his unusual speed ; but was still pressing onward , in the same wild and disordered manner , when the sudden dashing past of a carriage : and a boisterous cry from the foot passengers , who saw his danger : drove him back upon the pavement .

Nor were there wanting other indications of the good gentleman ' s having gone down in the world of late : for a great scarcity of furniture , and total absence of comfort , together with the disappearance of all such small moveables as spare clothes and linen , bespoke a state of extreme poverty ; while the meagre and attenuated condition of Mr . Sikes himself would have fully confirmed these symptoms , if they had stood in any need of corroboration .
In obedience to this hint , the boys , nodding to Nancy , took up their hats , and left the room ; the Dodger and his vivacious friend indulging , as they went , in many witticisms at the expense of Mr . Chitling ; in whose conduct , it is but justice to say , there was nothing very conspicuous or peculiar : inasmuch as there are a great number of spirited young bloods upon town , who pay a much higher price than Mr . Chitling for being seen in good society : and a great number of fine gentlemen ( composing the good society aforesaid ) who established their reputation upon very much the same footing as flash Toby Crackit .
Mr .

They do not see far enough , they do not see what is below them : whereas a man who would talk to any purpose about value and non - value must be able to see five hundred convictions beneath him - - and behind him .
In rare and isolate instances it may really be the case that such a will to truth , some extravagant and adventurous courage , a metaphysician ' s ambition to hold a hopeless position , may participate and ultimately prefer even a handful of " certainty " to a whole carload of beautiful possibilities ; there may actually be puritanical fanatics of conscience who prefer even a certain nothing to an uncertain something to lie down on - and die .
A proper physio - psychology has to contend with unconscious resistance in the heart of the investigator , it has " the heart " against it : even a doctrine of the reciprocal dependence of the " good ' and the " wicked ' drives , causes ( as refined immorality ) distress and aversion in a still hale and hearty conscience - still more so , a doctrine of the derivation of good impulses from wicked ones .
Instead of the consequences , the origin : indeed a reversal of perspective !
For the strong and independent prepared and predestined for command , in whom the art and reason of a ruling race is incarnated , religion is one more means of overcoming resistance so as to be able to rule : as a bond that unites together ruler and ruled and betrays and hands over to the former the consciences of the latter , all that is hidden and most intimate in them which would like to exclude itself from obedience ; and if some natures of such noble descent incline through lofty spirituality to a more withdrawn and meditative life and reserve to themselves only the most refined kind of rule ( over select disciples or brothers ) , then religion can even be used as a means of obtaining peace from the noise and effort of cruder modes of government , and cleanliness from the necessary dirt of all politics .
When one has dealings with scholars and artists it is easy to miscalculate in opposite directions : behind a remarkable scholar one not infrequently finds a mediocre man , and behind a mediocre artist often - a very remarkable man .
Clever people are not credited with their follies : what a deprivation of human rights !
In regard to a woman , for example , the more modest man . counts the simple disposal of her body and sexual gratification as a sufficient and satisfactory sign of having , of possession ; another , with a more jealous and demanding thirst for possession , sees the ` question - mark ' , the merely apparent quality of such a having and requires subtler tests , above all in order to know whether the woman not only gives herself to him but also gives up for his sake what she has or would like to have - : only thus does she count to him as ` possessed ' .
For into these moralists too ( whom one has to read with mental reservations if one has to read them at all - ) there has crept that old English vice called cant , which is moral tartuffery , this time concealed in the new form of scientificality ; there are also signs of a secret struggle with pangs of conscience , from which a race of former Puritans will naturally suffer .
Not one of all these ponderous herd animals with their uneasy conscience ( who undertake to advocate the cause of egoism as the cause of the general welfare - ) wants to know or scent that the ` general welfare ' is not an ideal , or a goal , or a concept that can be grasped at all , but only an emetic - that what is right for one cannot by any means therefore be right for another , that the demand for one morality for all is detrimental to precisely the higher men , in short that there exists an order of rank between man and man , consequently also between morality and morality .
If a people is suffering and wants to suffer from nationalistic nervous fever and political ambition , it must be expected that all sorts of clouds and disturbances - in short , little attacks of stupidity - will pass over its spirit into the bargain : among present - day Germans , for example , now the anti - French stupidity , now the anti - Jewish , now the anti - Polish , now the Christian - romantic , now the Wagnerian , now the Teutonic , now the Prussian ( just look at those miserable historians , those Sybels and Treitschkes , with their thickly bandaged heads - ) , and whatever else these little obfuscations of the German spirit and conscience may be called .
To refrain mutually from injury , from violence , from exploitation , and put one ' s will on a par with that of others : this may result in a certain rough sense in good conduct among individuals when the necessary conditions are given ( namely , the actual similarity of the individuals in amount of force and degree of worth , and their co - relation within one organisation ) .
By doing this , isn ' t Archilochus ( the first artist called subjective ) essentially a non - artist ?

As a writer he has mastered everything except language : as a novelist he can do everything , except tell a story : as an artist he is everything except articulate .
As he put it : for a child to be tied to its mother ' s apron strings is bad , but for a mother to be tied to a baby ' s apron strings is serious .
